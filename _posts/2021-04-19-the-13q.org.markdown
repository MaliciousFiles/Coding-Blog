Hello, and welcome back! Recently a classmate reached out because he saw a project on my GitHub, and asked me if I would help him on his project. I know that I talked about working on Aviar last time, but I am now going to help develop a Minecraft plugin for managing a server. The name of the server is 13Q and it's still in development, but the website is at [13Q.org].

My current job over the next week is to refamiliarize myself with with the Spigot API since it's been a while since I coded using it, and I'll do that by making a custom explosion. My current idea is to make an explosion that will throw blocks around (including having falling blocks in mid-air). I will probably post again around the end of the week with an update on 13Q, so see you then!

[13Q.org]: 13q.org
