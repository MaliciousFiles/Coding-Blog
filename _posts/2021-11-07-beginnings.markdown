Ok ok, I know it's Sunday rather than Saturday, but I was busy! In fact, busy beginning ReLife as you may have seen in the categories! Now, I've mentioned Hunger Games in Minecraft previously, but that was just my working title. Thanks to the input and brainstorming of my friends, we've come up with a few twists on Hunger Games. One of those twists is adding some sort of "ticket". You get 3 when you start, and when someone dies, as long as it is before midnight, you can revive them using 1 of those tickets - or you can revive yourself using all 3. It adds more complexity to the game, as if you revive a single one of your allies, you won't be able to revive yourself. Anyway, thats where the working title "ReLife" comes from - being able to revive yourself or others. Another twist that I'm thinking about is some sort of "renown" points that you get on kills (and maybe some just for surviving kills?), and when you're a spectator (once you've died past midnight), those, along with remaining tickets, turn into some sort of spectator points that you can use to activate stage hazards. Hazards might include a wall of fire, a pit trap, mutants, etc. In case I haven't previously mentioned it, or you just forgot, this will be similar to the 75th Hunger Games arena (3rd quarter quell) - the clock map. There will be 12 zones, and I'm starting by coding those in using a plugin, I've made lightning storm, blood rain, poisonous fog, beepers (bee-creeper mutant), and The Beast (ravager-wither mutant). Most of those aren't quite finished yet, but the baseline is there.

If you have any ideas about other possible twists for ReLife, feel free to contact me! One other thing I'd like to mention, and this won't matter for a while yet, I am planning on making a YouTube channel to showcase my projects. I will continue to post on this blog every week, but whenever I'm done with projects I'll likely post a video about it on the channel. I'm planning on kickstarting it with ReLife, so again, it'll be a while but watch out for that in a future post.

Thank you all for reading, I'm super excited about ReLife, and see you next week.

PS: The Aternos bot is technically done, but I still can't figure out how to keep the repl alive forever since I have to have a selenium instance running for the bot to work. If you have any ideas I'd love to hear them.
