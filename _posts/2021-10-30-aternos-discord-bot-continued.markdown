Alright, I'm sure you're dismayed at the title since I said that I would be done with the Discord bot last week, but... here we are. As always I spent forever on the tiny little QOL details that no one will care about, not that anyone but me will probably use the bot anyway, but it was fun. Lots of Python in the past couple of weeks. Aaaaanyway, I'm *probably* done now, once I figure out a way to keep it online indefinitely. Also, you guys should definitely be getting emails if you're subscribed (which I assume everyone is), so please [send me an email] if you aren't. Don't have much to say, it's Halloween weekend but unfortunately I'm feeling ill (not COVID, don't worry), so I probably won't be able to go out with friends tomorrow. That does mean of course, that I will probably get some coding done. Probably. I also have some homework, and a  couple of projects coming up. I really don't have anything to say, this past week has been pretty uneventful in terms of my prgramming, so hopefully I'll have some more news in a week about BTD6 modding, Minecraft plugins, something.

Thanks for reading, and as always, see you next time.
