Well it's Saturday and here I am as promised! Now first things first, you've probably seen the title but here's a little tangent: newsletter! I bet you've seen it on the home page, but if you scroll down to the bottom you should be able to sign up to a newsletter to receive emails any time I post. I just set it up this morning, so I have no idea if it works but I've signed up myself so we'll see. In case you're curious I'm using Feed Burner by Google which can scan your page's `feed.xml` file (if you want to see mine its at [https://maliciousfiles.github.io/blog/feed.xml]). It provides you with some nifty HTML to put into your website, I added a little CSS and JavaScript to make it fancy, and it handles the rest! Theoretically any time I add a new post, thereby adding a new page, thereby updating the feed.xml, thereby alerting Feed Burner, it should send out an email!

Now on to the title. Since you're reading this I assume that you're an intellectual who A) enjoys coding, B) wants to learn coding, or C) enojoys reading about cool projects. Well taking all that into account, you've likely read, watched, or at least heard of The Hunger Games. If you haven't, in the second book there is an arena based on a clock. It consists of a ring of dense jungle, then a beach, and then salt water surrounding the cornucopia (the place where all the weapons and other supplies are). The jungle is divided up into 12 sectors (not physically) and every hour a different sector activates with different effects. If you want to know more go to [https://thehungergames.fandom.com/wiki/75th_Hunger_Games_arena]. Anyway, I wanted to make that in Minecraft to play with my friends! It would be a fairly simple plugin, just has to activate something every "hour" in the correct segment. I don't have much more information, because I'm still busy with the BTD6 mod, but that's coming up! The only issue will be the logistics with 12-24 people on at once to play, but I'm sure I can sort that. Once it's done it will of course be public on GitHub if anyone else wants to try and set it up with their friends, or look at my code for inspiration.

As for the BTD6 mod, I don't have much to say as I've been busy with the end of a grading period in school and all the major grades that come with it. This weekend I'm planning on getting a lot done so I can hopefully give it to a YouTuber to showcase and move on to another project.

Thats all for today and as always, see you next week.
